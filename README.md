# Bill-Splitter

Ever faced a situation where you, along with your friends go to a restaurant and when the bill arrives one of you had to open the calculator and do the (bill amount/no of friends) calculationa and also if you want to give some tip then you have to do the mannual calculation? Well, you don't have to do no more ! Cuz there's a web application for it now.

This web application helps us to calculate the total restaurent amount after adding the tip and split the bill among our friends. 
It will divide the total sum equally among the group of friends based on the user's selection of the number of friends and the tip to be given. 

My very first web application.
