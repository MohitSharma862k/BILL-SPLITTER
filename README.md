# Bill-Splitter

Ever faced a situation where you, along with your friends go to a restaurant and when the bill arrives one of you had to open the calculator and do the (bill amount/no of friends) calculations? And also if there is GST on it then you have to include this tax amount as well. Well, you don't have to do all this any more ! Cuz there's a web application for it now.

This web application helps us to calculate the total restaurent amount after adding the tax and split the bill among our friends. 
It will divide the total sum equally among the group of friends based on the user's selection of the number of friends and the tax to be applied. 

My very first web application.
